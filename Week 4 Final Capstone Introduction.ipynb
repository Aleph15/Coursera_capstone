    "#### Starting a new business it's something that must be well analised, so this project is reviewed for the Mexico City market according to the different categories of business and places existing in the City.\n",
    "#### Currently I'm looking forward to start an Icecream business in order to increase my income sources, so I decided to use this capstone to analise the best options in order to deliver this new idea and take de decision on a Data Science Report.\n",
    "#### The goal is to understand the different neighborhoods in Mexico City according to people preferences and decide an option to start this new adventure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The audience of this capstone is all entrepeneur who wants to start a business in Mexico City and reviewing the different kind of venues existing so this applies for al kind of business that are demanded in this city.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data used\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data that I wil use is a list of the neighborhoods in Mexico City from Wikipedia, a list of the coordinates of each neighborhood, and a request from Foursquare to obtain the diferent kind of venues that are in the city an it's neighborhoods creating 10 clusters trough a Kmeans algorithm. The way I pretend to obtain the coordinates is trough a loop function with geocoder because there is no dataset available with this info. Finally I'll create a map to visualize the clustering and to decide the best option for the icecream store. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Below I give an example of the data set to be used considering the different neighborhoods to be analised.\n"
