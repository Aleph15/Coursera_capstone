    "#### Currently I'm looking forward to start an Icecream business in order to increase my income sources, so I decided to use this capstone to analise the best options in order to deliver this new idea and take de decision on a Data Science Report. \n",
    "#### The goal is to understand the different neighborhoods in Mexico City according to people preferences and decide an option to start this new adventure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data used\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data that I wil use is a list of the neighborhoods in Mexico City from Wikipedia, a list of the coordinates of each neighborhood, and a request from Foursquare to obtain the diferent kind of venues that are in the city an it's neighborhoods creating 10 clusters trough a Kmeans algorithm. The way I pretend to obtain the coordinates is trough a loop function with geocoder because there is no dataset available with this info. Finally I'll create a map to visualize the clustering and to decide the best option for the icecream store. "
